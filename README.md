# BigDaddy Deals — Static E‑commerce Template

This repository contains a lightweight, responsive static e‑commerce template for a fictional company "BigDaddy Deals". It's intended as a starting point you can customize and extend.

What's included
- `index.html` — homepage with product grid, search, and cart sidebar
- `styles.css` — responsive styles
- `app.js` — client-side product rendering and simple cart stored in `localStorage`

How to view locally (Windows PowerShell)
1. Open the folder in VS Code or a file explorer.
2. The easiest way is to open `index.html` directly in your browser by double-clicking it.
3. For a better local experience (recommended), run a simple local server. In PowerShell run:

```powershell
# using Python 3 (if installed)
python -m http.server 8000
# or, if you have Node.js installed, use a simple server like 'serve' or 'http-server'
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

Next steps / ideas
- Replace placeholder images with real product images and thumbnails.
- Integrate a backend or headless commerce API for real product data and checkout.
- Add authentication, user accounts, and order history.
- Add unit tests and build tooling if you adopt a framework.
